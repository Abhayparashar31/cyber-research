# <pir_title>

**PIR ID:** <pir_id> | **Status:** <pir_status> | **Priority:** <priority> | **Owner:** <pir_owner>

## Primary Intelligence Question

> **<primary_question>**

### Sub-Questions
Break the primary question into answerable components:
1.
2.
3.

> **Guidance:** A good PIR is decision-focused, not curiosity-driven. Ask: *What decision will this intelligence enable?* If you can't name a decision, reconsider the PIR.

---

## Business Context & Rationale

### Why Does This PIR Exist?
Describe the business problem, threat scenario, or risk gap this PIR addresses:
-

### Business Drivers
What organizational objective, risk register item, or leadership concern created this requirement?
-

### Risk Themes
What categories of risk does this PIR address?
- Fraud / Financial Loss
- Ransomware / Business Disruption
- Regulatory / Compliance Exposure
- Account Takeover / Identity Risk
- Supply Chain / Third-Party Risk
- Reputational Damage
- Other:

---

## Stakeholders, Owner & Consumers

| Role | Name / Team | Responsibility |
|------|------------|----------------|
| PIR Owner | | Accountable for collection, analysis, and reporting |
| Primary Stakeholder | | Requested or funds this PIR |
| Intelligence Consumers | | Teams that act on the intelligence produced |

> **Note:** Clearly separating owners from consumers prevents unclear accountability when answers are needed urgently.

---

## Scope & Boundaries

### Category
- **Strategic** — Long-horizon questions about adversary intent, geopolitical context
- **Operational** — Questions about active campaigns, actor behavior, targeting
- **Tactical** — Short-term, incident-linked, specific IOC or TTP focus
- **Technical** — Product/system-level questions about vulnerabilities, configurations

### Focus Areas
-

### Time Horizon
- **Duration:** <time_horizon>
- **Review Cadence:** <review_cadence>

### In Scope
Define what this PIR explicitly covers:
-

### Out of Scope
Define what is deliberately excluded — avoids scope creep:

## Required Intelligence Outputs

What products or deliverables will this PIR generate?

| Output Type | Frequency | Audience | Format |
|-------------|-----------|----------|--------|
<<<<<<< HEAD
| Weekly briefing inclusion | Weekly | Security leadership | Briefings |
| Threat actor profile update | As needed | SOC / IR | Threat Actors |
=======
| Weekly briefing inclusion | Weekly | Security leadership | `[[Briefings/]]` |
| Threat actor profile update | As needed | SOC / IR | `[[03_Threat_Actors/]]` |
>>>>>>> 969d4c9e3e080b2bb6eb8aee7efbd103063a5e8c
| Hunt package | Quarterly | Threat hunting team | KQL / Sigma |
| Incident enrichment | Per incident | IR team | Case notes |

### Success Criteria
How will you know this PIR is being answered effectively?
- Decision-makers can answer [specific question] using CTI output
- Detection coverage improves for [specific threat type]
- Reduction in [specific loss type or incident category]
- Time to answer stakeholder ad-hoc questions drops to < [threshold]

## Collection Guidance

### Key Collection Topics
What specific information must be collected to answer this PIR?
-

### Internal Collection Sources

| Source | Type | Collection Method | Frequency |
|--------|------|-------------------|-----------|
| SIEM / Splunk | Log analysis | Automated query | Continuous |
| EDR (CrowdStrike / Defender) | Endpoint telemetry | Hunt / alert review | Daily |
| Email security gateway | Phishing analysis | Alert triage | Daily |
| Identity / IAM logs | Auth events | UEBA / manual review | Daily |
| Threat intel platform | Enrichment | Automated / manual | Per indicator |

### External Collection Sources

| Source | Type | Collection Method |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Commercial threat intel feeds | Structured IOC / reporting | API / manual |
| ISAC / industry sharing | Sector-specific intel | Membership feeds |
| OSINT (Shodan, VirusTotal, etc.) | Technical recon | Manual / automated |
| Vendor advisories | Vulnerability / threat | RSS / email |
| Government advisories (CISA, FBI) | Threat / vulnerability | RSS / manual |

### Collection Methods
- Automated log ingestion and alerting
- Proactive threat hunting
- Case-driven investigation and enrichment
- OSINT and open-source research
- Vendor and partner intelligence sharing

### Constraints & Considerations
- Legal or privacy restrictions on collection
- Data retention limitations
- Technical gaps (blind spots in logging or telemetry)
- Resource constraints on analyst time

---

## Data Sources & Telemetry Requirements

Document the specific datasets needed to reliably answer this PIR.

### Internal Data Sources
- SIEM tables (specify table names if known)
- EDR telemetry (process events, network events, file events)
- Identity and IAM logs (Active Directory, Entra ID, Okta)
- Email security logs (inbound/outbound mail metadata)
- Application logs (loan origination system, servicing platforms, etc.)
- Network logs (DNS, proxy, firewall, NetFlow)

### External Data Sources
- Named commercial feeds and what they provide
- ISAC / sharing community subscriptions
- Open-source feeds (Abuse.ch, MISP communities, etc.)
- Vendor threat reports relevant to this PIR
